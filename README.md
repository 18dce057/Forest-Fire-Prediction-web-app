# Forest-Fire-Prediction-web-app

Forest fire prediction is a web application which is use to predict the probability of fire occurring in forest.
For prediction it will take input Oxygen, Humidity and temperature.

Oxygen Level: For any fire take place, high oxygen content is required. So higher the oxygen more is the probability of a wildfire taking place  
Temperature: Obviously for a fire to take place, heat is favorable. Hence high temperature increases the probability of fire in any region. 
Humidity: Obviously Humid weather is unfavorable for a fire, whereas a dry weather is. Therefore, higher the humidity, lower the probability of a fire taking place.
